## How to navigate without context in Flutter?

Navigation is an integral part of any App. Flutter makes it really easy to navigate to any screen by using simple navigator functions like Push and Pop.

**To push:**
```
Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => SecondRoute()),
);
``` 

**To Pop:**
```
Navigator.pop(context);
```

This works great until your app scales and you separate your business logic with the UI logic. And now you have to pass [BuildContext](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BuildContext-class.html) from one function to another function. This becomes a big hassle. 

Don't worry [NavigatorKey](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/navigatorKey.html) is to the rescue.

### 1. Create a Navigator Key

```
static final navigatorKey = GlobalKey<NavigatorState>();
``` 

### 2. Pass the Navigator Key in MaterialApp

```
    return MaterialApp(
      ...
      navigatorKey: AppRouter.navigatorKey,
    );
```

### 3. Push using the Navigator Key

```
navigatorKey.currentState?.push(
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => SecondRoute()),
);
```

That's it with just 3 easy steps you can eliminate context from your Navigation.
