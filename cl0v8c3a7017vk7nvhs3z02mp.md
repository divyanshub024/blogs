## Speed up your Flutter development with Mason

Every organization I have worked with was under pressure to release the product sooner, sending faster updates and bug fixes. Although there are many factors that contribute to the development speed, one thing which always slowed me down is writing the boilerplate code. In a usual project, it can consist of up to 30% of the total code. This makes me wonder if there is a way possible to generate these codes. Which brought me to [Mason](https://github.com/felangel/mason). So what is Mason?

> Mason enables developers to create and consume reusable templates called bricks.

Basically, Mason is a template generator where each template is called bricks. Mason provides [Mason CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/mason_cli) to create and consume these templates.
 
Although Mason is written in dart and it's gaining popularity in the Flutter community but it can be used to generate templates for any language. Let's see how we can use this in our project to speed up our development.

### Installation

Mason can be installed either with the dart pub or brew.

```
# üéØ Activate from https://pub.dev
dart pub global activate mason_cli

# üç∫ Or install from https://brew.sh
brew tap felangel/mason
brew install mason
``` 
Mason provides quite a few commands to build templates.

### Initialisation 

Once you've installed mason_cli you can go into the root folder of your project and initialize mason.

```
mason init
``` 

This will generate the `mason.yaml` file in your project which contains metadata for all your bricks. 

```
# Register bricks that can be consumed via the Mason CLI.
# https://github.com/felangel/mason
bricks:
  # Sample Brick
  # Run `mason make hello` to try it out.
  hello: 0.1.0+1
  # Bricks can also be imported via git url.
  # Uncomment the following lines to import
  # a brick from a remote git url.
  # widget:
  #   git:
  #     url: https://github.com/felangel/mason.git
  #     path: bricks/widget

```

### Bricks üß±

Bricks simply are customizable reusable templates that can generate code with dynamic variables. These brick templates can be stored locally in the project, remotely in git, or can be published to the [brickhub](https://brickhub.dev/). 

Mason uses [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html), a logic less template syntax. To know more about mustache check this [documentation](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).

A new brick template can be created with the `mason new` command. 

`mason new <BRICK_NAME> -d <DISCRIPTION>`

```
mason new cubit -d "A new cubit template"
‚úì Created new brick: cubit (0.0s)
‚úì Generated 5 file(s):
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/bricks/cubit/brick.yaml (new)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/bricks/cubit/README.md (new)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/bricks/cubit/CHANGELOG.md (new)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/bricks/cubit/LICENSE (new)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/bricks/cubit/__brick__/HELLO.md (new)
```

Each brick template consists of the following files and folders.

 
1. `__brick__` directory: All your template files are added to this Directory.
2. `bricks.yaml`: A metadata file for your brick template.
 
```
name: cubit
description: A new cubit template

# The following defines the version and build number for your brick.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.34
# followed by an optional build number (separated by a +).
version: 0.1.0+1

# The following defines the environment for the current brick.
# It includes the version of mason that the brick requires.
environment:
  mason: ">=0.1.0-dev <0.1.0"

# Variables specify dynamic values that your brick depends on.
# Zero or more variables can be specified for a given brick.
# Each variable has:
#  * a type (string, number, or boolean)
#  * an optional short description
#  * an optional default value
#  * an optional prompt phrase used when asking for the variable.
vars:
  name:
    type: string
    description: Cubit name
    default: Dash
    prompt: What's the cubit name?

```

You can see that we have defined a variable `name`. Which will be the name of the cubit class.

Let's jump to the `__brick__` directory and start writing the cubit template. Let's create 2 directories `lib` and `test`with nested directory `cubit`. 

Now we need to create a directory with a cubit name. For that, we can create a new directory with directory name as `{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}}`.

This will be the folder structure of the `__brick__` directory.

```
--__brick__
  |--lib
  |  |--cubit
  |  |  |--{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}} 
  |
  |--test
  |  |--cubit
  |  |  |--{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}} 
  | 
  |....
```

In the `--lib -> cubit -> {{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}}` we will create a state class and a cubit class. 

`{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_state{{/snakeCase}}.dart`

```
part of '{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_cubit{{/snakeCase}}.dart';

class {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}} extends Equatable {
  const {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}}();

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [];
}
```

`{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_cubit{{/snakeCase}}.dart`

```
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

part '{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_state{{/snakeCase}}.dart';

class {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}Cubit{{/pascalCase}} extends Cubit<{{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}}> {
  {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}Cubit{{/pascalCase}}() : super(const {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}}());

}
```

In `--test -> cubit -> {{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}}` we will create a cubit test class.

`{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_cubit_test{{/snakeCase}}.dart`

```
import 'package:bloc_test/bloc_test.dart';
import 'package:mason_demo/cubit/{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}{{/snakeCase}}/{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_cubit{{/snakeCase}}.dart';

void main() {
  blocTest(
    'emits [] when nothing is added',
    build: () => {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}Cubit{{/pascalCase}}(),
    expect: () => [],
  );
}
```

Now we are done with our templates let's add them to `mason.yaml`. 

```
bricks:
  #Bricks
  cubit:
    path: bricks/cubit
```

### Installing Bricks

To install bricks simply run the `mason get` command.

### Generating code

This is where the magic happens. Every time we need to create a new cubit we can simply run the `mason makes cubit` command.

```
mason make cubit

? What's the cubit name? (Dash) Auth
‚úì Made brick cubit (0.1s)
‚úì Generated 3 file(s):
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/StudioProjects/mason_demo/test/cubit/auth/auth_cubit_test.dart (identical)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/StudioProjects/mason_demo/lib/cubit/auth/auth_cubit.dart (new)
  /Users/divyanshubhargava/StudioProjects/mason_demo/lib/cubit/auth/auth_state.dart (new)
```

Voil√†, within a fraction of seconds we can generate all our cubit files. 

**auth_cubit.dart**

```
import 'package:equatable/equatable.dart';
import 'package:flutter_bloc/flutter_bloc.dart';

part 'auth_state.dart';

class AuthCubit extends Cubit<AuthState> {
  AuthCubit() : super(const AuthState());

}
```

**auth_state.dart**

```
part of 'auth_cubit.dart';

class AuthState extends Equatable {
  const AuthState();

  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [];
}
```

**auth_cubit_test.dart**

```
import 'package:bloc_test/bloc_test.dart';
import 'package:mason_demo/cubit/auth/auth_cubit.dart';

void main() {
  blocTest(
    'emits [] when nothing is added',
    build: () => AuthCubit(),
    expect: () => [],
  );
}
```

### Adding conditions

One thing which I found really helpful while generating code is to able to have conditional code. For example, if you want to generate a new cubit and state class without Equatable. To do so let's add a new variable called `useEquatable` in our `brick.yaml` file.

```
useEquatable:
    type: boolean
    description: Use Equatable
    default: false
    prompt: Do you want to use Equatable?
```
Now wrap the Equatable code in `useEquatable` variable.

```
{{#useEquatable}}
// Your code
{{/useEquatable}}
```
Finally, this is how our state's class looks like.

```
part of '{{#snakeCase}}{{name}}_cubit{{/snakeCase}}.dart';

class {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}} {{#useEquatable}}extends Equatable{{/useEquatable}} {
  const {{#pascalCase}}{{name}}State{{/pascalCase}}();

 {{#useEquatable}}
  @override
  List<Object?> get props => [];
 {{/useEquatable}}
}
```

### Some useful mason commands

 #### List installed Bricks

```
mason list

//or

mason ls
```
#### Add Bricks

```
mason add <BRICK_NAME>
```

#### Remove Bricks

```
mason remove <BRICK_NAME>
```

### What's next? 

What we have done here is just the tip of the iceberg. With Mason, you can achieve a lot.
